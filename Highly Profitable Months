# Highly Profitable Months
# The Stocks of a company are being surveyed to analyse the net profit of the company over a period

# For an analysis parameter k, an interval of k concutive months is said to be hightly profitable if the values of the stock prices are strictly increasing for those months. 
# Given the stock prices of the company for n months and the analysis parameter k find the number of highly profitable intervals.
# Example : stockPrices=[5,3,5,7,8], K=3
# Here the answer is 2
