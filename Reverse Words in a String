Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        #split by spaces
        #for each element, ensure it's not empty
        #if not, then push to stack
        #pop from the stack backwards, appending a space each time

        s = s.split(" ")
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if (s[i] != ""):
