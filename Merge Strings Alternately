1768. Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):

        #stored string
        #for each letter in word1/word2, append alternating
        #check which is longer, and add the remaining to the string

        word = ''

        word1_len = len(word1) 
        word2_len = len(word2)
        for i in range(min(word1_len, word2_len)):
            word += word1[i] + word2[i]

        else:
