#This problem was asked by Facebook.

# Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, 
# pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

#Two cases:
#multiple passes through input stream allowed? 
  # 1. Then use one pass to count the number of elements,
  # 2. randomly generate a number (using Random package or some equivalent)
  # 3. Use second pass to grab the item at that number
  
#single pass through input stream only?
  # use Reservoir Sampling, but with a sample size of 1
