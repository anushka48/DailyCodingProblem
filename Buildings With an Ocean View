#Given an array of integers heights of length n, indicating that there are n buildings, heights[i] represents the height of the building at the corresponding position.

#To the right of a building is the ocean, and for each building, if all buildings to the right of that building are strictly lower than it, then that building has a view of the ocean.

#Returns a list of indexed subscripts of all buildings with an ocean view, in ascending order, with index subscripts starting at 0.
